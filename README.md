## A C++ compiler written in C

### Compiling:
1) Linux:
gcc -o compiler compiler.c

2) Windows (MinGW или Cygwin):
gcc -o compiler.exe compiler.c

No additional libraries are required for compilation and execution.

Currently, setting your own file for compilation is not supported. The source file that needs to be compiled must be named source.cpp.
